## 📊 Project Summary

- 📊 **Dataset**: [Titanic – Kaggle Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)
- 🧹 Cleaned missing data (`Age`, `Embarked`)
- 📈 Explored survival patterns based on:
  - Gender
  - Passenger class
  - Age
- 🤖 Applied **Logistic Regression** model
- 🧠 Evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
